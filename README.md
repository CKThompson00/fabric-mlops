# Fabric MLOps Accelerator Repository
This repo is an accelerator help to help kick start using MLOps with Microsoft Fabric.  Microsoft Fabric supports mlflow and uses the Azure Machine Learning model registry to support managing models inside of a workspace. 


## Setup Steps
1. Create a Development Workspace to contain the artifacts.
2. Within the workspace create a new folder designating the Project for the given model development work (in my case it is MLOps Framework)
